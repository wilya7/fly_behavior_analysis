Below is a detailed blueprint that breaks the project into a series of small, iterative chunks. Each chunk is then further decomposed into very small steps that can be implemented safely with strong testing. At the end, you’ll find a series of code-generation prompts—each in its own markdown code block tagged as `text`—that you can feed to your code-generation LLM. Each prompt builds on the previous work and ends with wiring things together.

---

## Detailed Blueprint

### 1. Project Setup & Environment
- **Goal:** Establish the project structure and basic configuration.
- **Steps:**
  - Create a project folder.
  - Initialize a Python environment (e.g., Conda environment, requirements.txt).
  - Create the main script file (e.g., `main.py`).
  - Set up a folder for tests (e.g., `tests/`).
  - Document the project (create a README file).

### 2. CLI Interface & Argument Parsing
- **Goal:** Implement a command-line interface using `argparse`.
- **Steps:**
  - Parse required parameters (input file/directory, output folder, optional total frame count).
  - Ensure that if the output folder exists, the script exits with an error.
  - Print basic status messages on startup.

### 3. Input Processing & Validation
- **Goal:** Read the CSV file(s) and validate the data.
- **Steps:**
  - Read the input CSV using Pandas.
  - Extract the **Frame** column and convert to integers.
  - Validate that the column exists.
  - Check that the number of entries is even (otherwise, record an error).
  - Ensure that frame numbers are strictly increasing.

### 4. Event Pairing & Timeline Table Generation
- **Goal:** Create the timeline table that maps frames 1 to N with grooming events.
- **Steps:**
  - Interpret the frame entries as alternating start and stop values.
  - For each valid pair, ensure that start ≤ stop and that frames are within range.
  - Create a DataFrame for frames 1 to N.
  - Update the DataFrame rows for each event: mark `GroomingFlag = 1` and assign a unique `EventID`.

### 5. Event List Generation
- **Goal:** Build an event list DataFrame that logs each event’s start and stop frames.
- **Steps:**
  - For every valid event, record the `EventID`, `StartFrame`, and `StopFrame`.
  - Save this as a CSV file using the naming convention.

### 6. Visualizations
- **Goal:** Create visual outputs for the processed data.
- **Steps:**
  - **Timeline Plot:** Produce a static image (PNG) that color-codes the grooming segments along frames 1 to N.
  - **Box Plot:** Produce a static image (PNG) showing the distribution of event durations.

### 7. Consolidated Summary Report & Batch Processing
- **Goal:** Process multiple CSV files, aggregate results, and handle errors.
- **Steps:**
  - Process all CSV files in a given input directory.
  - For each file, if errors occur (e.g., missing column, odd number of frames, non-increasing order), log them to an `errorLog.csv` and skip the file.
  - For successful files, generate individual outputs (timeline table, event list, plots) following the naming conventions.
  - Generate a consolidated summary CSV that aggregates per-file and overall metrics.

### 8. Testing & Continuous Integration
- **Goal:** Ensure that each function is tested incrementally.
- **Steps:**
  - Write unit tests (using PyTest) for:
    - CSV reading and input validation.
    - Event pairing logic.
    - Timeline table and event list generation.
    - Visualization outputs (basic verification of file creation).
    - Batch processing and error logging.
  - Write integration tests that run through the entire process with a mix of valid and faulty files.

### 9. Final Wiring & Integration
- **Goal:** Wire all functions together in the main script.
- **Steps:**
  - Combine CLI parsing, file processing, output generation, and error logging.
  - Print status messages for each file processed.
  - Ensure that the script exits gracefully with a final consolidated report.

   - Wire in error handling so that faulty files are logged and skipped.
   - After processing all files, produce the consolidated summary report.
   - Write tests simulating a directory with multiple files (valid and faulty).

8. **Final Main Script Wiring**

     - Parses CLI arguments.
     - Checks and creates the output folder.
     - Iterates over input files.
     - Calls processing functions and prints status messages.
   - Ensure that every function is connected and that no orphaned code remains.
   - Write an integration test that simulates the full run.

## Series of Code-Generation Prompts

Below are the individual prompts for the code-generation LLM. Each prompt is self-contained, builds on previous work, and ends with wiring things together.

---

```text
Prompt 1: Project Initialization & CLI Setup

Task: Set up the project structure and initialize the basic CLI parser.
Requirements:
- Create a Python script named "main.py".
- Initialize a basic project structure with a "tests" folder and a README file.
- In "main.py", implement CLI argument parsing using argparse to accept the following arguments:
  - --input (required): Input file or directory.
  - --output (required): Output directory.
  - --total_frames (optional): Total frame count (default: 8999).
- If the output directory already exists, print an error message and exit.
- Print a startup status message (e.g., "Starting processing...").

Provide inline documentation and a brief docstring for the main function.
End your prompt with code that wires the CLI parsing to a main() function stub.
```

---

```text
Prompt 2: Input CSV Processing and Validation

Task: Implement a function to process an input CSV file.
Requirements:
- Create a function (e.g., process_csv(file_path)) that:
  - Reads the CSV file using Pandas.
  - Checks for the presence of the "Frame" column.
  - Converts the values in the "Frame" column to integers.
  - Validates that the number of entries is even; if not, returns or raises an error.
  - Checks that the frames are in strictly increasing order; if not, logs the error.
- Include inline documentation and proper error handling.
- Write a basic test case (using PyTest) that tests valid input and various invalid scenarios (e.g., missing column, odd number of entries, non-increasing order).

End your prompt with wiring this function into a testable module.
```

---

```text
Prompt 3: Event Pairing and Timeline Table Generation

Task: Implement event pairing and generate the timeline table.
Requirements:
- Create a function (e.g., generate_timeline(frames, total_frames)) that:
  - Accepts a list of frame numbers (assumed to be validated and even in count) and the total frame count N.
  - Pairs the frame numbers as alternating start and stop values.
  - For each pair, validates that start <= stop.
  - Creates a Pandas DataFrame with rows for frame numbers 1 to N.
  - Initializes columns: "Frame", "GroomingFlag" (set to 0), and "EventID" (set to 0).
  - For each event pair, updates the DataFrame rows from start to stop (inclusive) by setting "GroomingFlag" = 1 and assigning a unique positive integer as "EventID".
- Document the function and include error handling for invalid pairs.
- Write tests to verify that for a given set of input frames, the timeline DataFrame is correctly generated.

End your prompt with wiring this function to be callable from the main script.
```

```text
Prompt 4: Event List Generation

Task: Generate an event list from the paired events.
Requirements:
- Create a function (e.g., generate_event_list(event_pairs)) that:
  - Accepts a list of valid event pairs (each pair containing a start and stop frame along with a unique EventID).
  - Returns a Pandas DataFrame or CSV with columns: "EventID", "StartFrame", "StopFrame".
- Ensure that the function documents the input and output clearly.
- Write tests to ensure that the event list DataFrame matches expected event pairs from the input.

End your prompt with integration wiring so that this function is called after event pairing.
```

```text
Prompt 5: Visualization Functions

Task: Implement visualization functions for the timeline plot and box plot.
Requirements:
- Create two functions:
  1. generate_timeline_plot(timeline_df, output_path):
     - Accepts the timeline DataFrame (from Prompt 3) and outputs a PNG image showing a color-coded timeline (e.g., color segments for grooming events).
  2. generate_box_plot(event_list_df, output_path):
     - Accepts the event list DataFrame (from Prompt 4) and outputs a PNG image showing a box plot of grooming event durations (calculated as StopFrame - StartFrame + 1).
- Use Matplotlib (or a similar library) for plotting.
- Each function should include inline documentation and basic error handling (e.g., check that the input DataFrame is not empty).
- Write tests that verify image files are generated (e.g., file existence after the function runs).

End your prompt with wiring these functions so that they are called with the generated DataFrames.
```

---

```text
Prompt 6: Error Logging, Batch Processing, and Summary Report

Task: Implement error logging, batch processing, and generation of a consolidated summary report.
Requirements:
- Create a function (e.g., log_error(file_name, error_type, details)) that writes an entry to an "errorLog.csv" with:
  - File name, error type, timestamp, and relevant details.
- Create a batch processing function (e.g., process_directory(input_dir, output_dir, total_frames)) that:
  - Iterates over each CSV file in the input directory.
  - For each file, calls the input processing and event pairing functions.
  - If errors occur for a file, logs the error and skips further processing for that file.
  - For valid files, generates outputs: timeline table CSV, event list CSV, timeline plot PNG, and box plot PNG.
  - Aggregates per-file metrics (e.g., number of events, total grooming duration, average/median event duration, percentage of grooming frames) into a consolidated summary report CSV.
  - Also tracks overall metrics: total files processed, successful files, and faulty files.
- Include inline documentation and tests to simulate both valid and faulty files.
- Ensure that this function integrates and calls the functions from Prompts 2–5.

End your prompt with wiring the batch processing in the main function.
```

---

```text
Prompt 7: Final Integration and Main Function Wiring

Task: Wire together all functions into a cohesive main function.
Requirements:
- In "main.py", create a main() function that:
  - Parses CLI arguments (from Prompt 1).
  - Checks for the existence of the output folder and creates it if it does not exist (or exits with an error if it does exist).
  - Determines if the input is a single file or a directory and calls the appropriate processing function.
  - For a directory, calls the batch processing function (from Prompt 6).
  - For a single file, calls the processing functions in order: input parsing, event pairing, timeline table generation, event list generation, and visualization.
  - Prints status messages for each major step (e.g., "Processing file X...", "File X processed successfully.", or error messages).
  - At the end, prints a summary report or writes it to a CSV.
- Include a guard (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to call main().
- Provide inline documentation for clarity.
- Write an integration test that simulates a run with sample inputs to ensure all components work together.

End your prompt with the complete wiring of the main function.
```

---

```text
Prompt 8: Unit and Integration Testing

Task: Write unit tests for each module and integration tests for the complete flow using PyTest.
Requirements:
- Create tests for:
  1. CSV processing and validation (e.g., valid CSV, missing "Frame" column, odd number of frames, non-increasing frames).
  2. Event pairing and timeline generation (verify that the timeline DataFrame is generated correctly for known input).
  3. Event list generation (verify that the event list DataFrame matches the expected output).
  4. Visualization functions (check that PNG files are generated, optionally validate file non-emptiness).
  5. Error logging (verify that errors are logged properly in "errorLog.csv").
  6. Batch processing (simulate processing a directory with a mix of valid and faulty CSV files and check that outputs and logs are as expected).
- Each test should be small, isolated, and verify only one aspect of the functionality.
- Provide inline comments and docstrings for each test case.
- Ensure that the tests can be run with a simple "pytest" command.

End your prompt with the full test suite wiring.
